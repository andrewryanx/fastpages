### HackerRank - Python: If-Else

## Problem:

Given an integer, _n_, perform the following conditional actions:

If _n_ is odd, print Weird
If _n_ is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If _n_ is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If _n_ is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

## Solution:

```python
def wierd(n):
    if n % 2 == 1 or 6 <= n <= 20:
        print('Weird')
    else:
        print('Not Weird')


wierd(int(input()))
```

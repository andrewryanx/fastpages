### HackerRank - SQL: The PADS

## Problem:

Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in **OCCUPATIONS**, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in **OCCUPATIONS**. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

```There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.```

where ```[occupation_count]``` is the number of occurrences of an occupation in **OCCUPATIONS** and ```[occupation]``` is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same ```[occupation_count]```, they should be ordered alphabetically.

**Note:** There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

The **OCCUPATIONS** table is described as follows: 

| Column | Type |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Name | String |
| Occupation | String |

Occupation will only contain one of the following values: **Doctor**, **Professor**, **Singer** or **Actor**.

An **OCCUPATIONS** table that contains the following records:

| Name | Occupation | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Samantha | Doctor |
| Julia | Actor |
| Maria | Actor |
| Meer | Singer |
| Ashley | Professor |
| Ketty | Professor |
| Christeen | Professor |
| Jane | Actor |
| Jenny | Doctor |
| Priya | Singer |

**Sample Output:**

```
Ashely(P)
Christeen(P)
Jane(A)
Jenny(D)
Julia(A)
Ketty(P)
Maria(A)
Meera(S)
Priya(S)
Samantha(D)
There are a total of 2 doctors.
There are a total of 2 singers.
There are a total of 3 actors.
There are a total of 3 professors.
```

## Solution:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(Name, '(', LEFT(Occupation,1),')') FROM OCCUPATIONS ORDER BY Name;
SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(Occupation), ' ', LOWER(Occupation), 's.') FROM OCCUPATIONS GROUP BY Occupation ORDER BY COUNT(Occupation), Occupation;
```
